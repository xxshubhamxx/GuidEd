# eLearning Website

## Description

A intermediate level eLearning Website (used APIs and user's localstorage but no backend) with a many tutorials, interactive and Responsive Webpages, top-class animations and much more!

## Acknowledgement

This web project has been completed due to combined efforts of Shubham, Abhiram, Bhargav, Sivesh and Lohith. We referred a lot of online resources like w3schools and communities like stackoverflow.com whenever we were stuck on something for a long time but this project is completely original and you can't find any similar project online that was published before this.

## Duration

This project was started on 1st June and was completed on 19th July. So, it took a total of 49 days to complete this project. However, a few sections embedded on the page were made earlier too.

## Previous Version

We created many webpage designs on figma and also many failed versions of the website before but they didn't work out. I would estimate an average of 200+ hours of work for all 5 creators of the website (includes coding, exploring and integrating the website).

## Live demo
