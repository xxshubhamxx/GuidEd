# eLearning Website

## Description

Making a good eLearning Website with a few tutorials. Interactive and Responsive Webpages with many cool animations.

## Previous Version

We created many webpage designs on figma and also many failed versions of the website before but they didn't work out. I would estimate an average of 200+ hours of work for all 5 creators of the website (includes coding, exploring and integrating the website).

## Live demo

The website is live at www.elearningweb.tk so feel free to check it out by clicking [here](www.elearningweb.tk)
