## Description

A intermediate level eLearning Website (used APIs and user's localstorage but no backend) with a many tutorials, interactive and Responsive Webpages, top-class animations and much more! Due to no backend, we could not create a real working website but we tried our best to use 100% power of HTML, CSS and JS and their libraries to make the front-end of a real website.

## Acknowledgement

This web project has been completed due to combined efforts of Shubham, Abhiram, Bhargav, Sivesh and Lohith. We referred a lot of online resources like w3schools and communities like stackoverflow.com whenever we were stuck on something for a long time but this project is completely original and you can't find any similar project online that was published before this.

## Duration

This project idea was finalised and coding was started on 21st May and the project was completed on 19th July. So, it took a total of 60 days (or 2 months) to create this project. However, a few sections embedded on the website were made earlier too. This includes Personal pages linked at main page in creator's section and C++ Project of Projects page. Although, we had many ideas to implement on the website like custom cursor, new projects and many more that couldn't be done due to time restriction of 2 months and busy schedule of the creators, we don't plan to make any new commits to the GitHub repository or develop the website anytime in near future.

## Previous Version

We created many webpage designs on figma and also many failed versions of the website before but they didn't work out. We would estimate that all the 5 creators devoted an **average** of 200+ hours to this project (includes coding, exploring and integrating the website).
