# eLearning Website

## Description

A intermediate level eLearning Website (used APIs and user's localstorage but no backend) with a many tutorials, interactive and Responsive Webpages, top-class animations and much more!

## Description

This web project has been completed due to combined efforts of Shubham, Abhiram, Bhargav, Sivesh and Lohith 

## Previous Version

We created many webpage designs on figma and also many failed versions of the website before but they didn't work out. I would estimate an average of 200+ hours of work for all 5 creators of the website (includes coding, exploring and integrating the website).

## Live demo
