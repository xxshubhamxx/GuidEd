# eLearning Website

## Description

A intermediate level eLearning Website (used APIs and user's localstorage but no backend) with a many tutorials, interactive and Responsive Webpages, top-class animations and much more! Due to no backend, we could not create a real working website but we tried our best to use 100% power of HTML, CSS and JS and their libraries to make the front-end of a real website.

## Acknowledgement

This web project has been completed due to combined efforts of Shubham, Abhiram, Bhargav, Sivesh and Lohith. We referred a lot of online resources like w3schools and communities like stackoverflow.com whenever we were stuck on something for a long time but this project is completely original and you can't find any similar project online that was published before this.

## Duration

This project idea was finalised and coding was started on 21st May and the project was completed on 19th July. So, it took a total of 60 days (or 2 months) to create this project. However, a few sections embedded on the website were made earlier too. This includes Personal pages linked at main page in creator's section and C++ Project of Projects page. We don't plan to make any new commits to the GitHub repository or develop the website anytime in near future.

## Previous Version

We created many webpage designs on figma and also many failed versions of the website before but they didn't work out. We would estimate an **average** of 200+ hours of work for all 5 creators of the website (includes coding, exploring and integrating the website).
