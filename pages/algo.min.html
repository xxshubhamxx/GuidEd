The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science like artificial intelligence, databases, graphics, networking, operating systems, security, and so on.

They're the building blocks for programming, and they allow things like computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions.<br>Algorithms are used to find the best possible way of solving a problem. In doing so they improve the efficiency of a program. When it comes to programming, efficiency can be used to mean different things. One of them is the accuracy of the software.<br>Algorithms are are used as specifications for data processing, doing mathematics, automated reasoning, and several other chores like this. Whether you are aware of it or not, algorithms are becoming a ubiquitous part of our lives.</div></div><div class="implementation none animate__animated" id="implementation"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="ih">Implementation:</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="id">In computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer to produce output from given input. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.<br>, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.</div></div><div class="examples none animate__animated" id="examples"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="eh">Examples:</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="ed"><li>There are numerous types of algorithms, generally built upon simpler primitive data types:</li><ol><li>One of the most obvious examples of an algorithm is a recipe. It's a finite list of instructions used to perform a task. For example, if you were to follow the algorithm to create brownies from a box mix, you would follow the three to five step process written on the back of the box.</li><li>There are three basic constructs in an algorithm Linear Sequence: is progression of tasks or statements that follow one after the other. Conditional: IF-THEN-ELSE is decision that is made between two course of actions. Loop: WHILE and FOR are sequences of statements that are repeated a number of times.</li><li>A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. An algorithm works by following a procedure, made up of inputs.</li><li>Most algorithms are guaranteed to produce the correct result. Itâ€™s rarely useful if an algorithm returns the largest number 99% of the time, but 1% of the time the algorithm fails and returns the smallest number instead.</li><li>An algorithm expects a defined set of inputs. For example, it might require two numbers where both numbers are greater than zero. Or it might require a word, or a list of zero or more numbers.</li></ol></div></div><div class="references none animate__animated" id="references"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="rh">References</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="rd">These are some of the references to read about Algorithms:<ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">Click here for Wikipedia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/">Click here for GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://paperpile.com/s/algorithms-citation-style/">Click here for paperpile</a></li><li><a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/">Click here for Algorithm4thedition</a></li></ol></div></div><div class="courses none animate__animated" id="courses"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="ch">Courses</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="cd">Courses offered by the academys through online for data structures<ol><li><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/algorithms">Click here for Edxcourses</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science/algorithms">Click here for Coursera</a></li><li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/topic/algorithms/">Click here for Udemy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.codespaces.com/best-data-structures-and-algorithms-courses-classes.html">Click here for CodeSpaces</a></li></ol></div></div></div></body></html>
