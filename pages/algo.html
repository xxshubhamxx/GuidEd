                Algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem. 
                The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science like artificial intelligence, databases, graphics,
                 networking, operating systems, security, and so on. Algorithm development is more than just programming.

                An algorithm is simply a set of steps used to complete a specific task. 
                They're the building blocks for programming, and they allow things like computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions.<br>

                Algorithms are used to find the best possible way of solving a problem. In doing so they improve the efficiency of a program. 
                When it comes to programming, efficiency can be used to mean different things. One of them is the accuracy of the software.<br>

                Algorithms are are used as specifications for data processing, doing mathematics, automated reasoning, and several other chores like this.
                Whether you are aware of it or not, algorithms are becoming a ubiquitous part of our lives.

                    There are numerous types of algorithms, generally built upon simpler primitive data types:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        One of the most obvious examples of an algorithm is a recipe. It's a finite list of instructions used to perform a task. 
                        For example, if you were to follow the algorithm to create brownies from a box mix, you would follow the three to five step process 
                        written on the back of the box.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       There are three basic constructs in an algorithm
                       Linear Sequence: is progression of tasks or statements that follow one after the other. 
                       Conditional: IF-THEN-ELSE is decision that is made between two course of actions. 
                       Loop: WHILE and FOR are sequences of statements that are repeated a number of times.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                       A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions 
                       in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. An algorithm works by following
                       a procedure, made up of inputs.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      Most algorithms are guaranteed to produce the correct result. It’s rarely useful if an algorithm returns the largest number 99% of the time,
                      but 1% of the time the algorithm fails and returns the smallest number instead. 
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      An algorithm expects a defined set of inputs. For example, it might require two numbers where both numbers are greater than zero. 
                      Or it might require a word, or a list of zero or more numbers.
