In terms of memory, an array is a group of contiguous memory locations storing data of the same type.</p></div><button class="accordion">Do you know about modeling languages? Give some examples.</button><div class="panel"><p>Any artificial language usable for expressing information or knowledge or systems in an arrangement determined by a reliable set of rules is called a modeling language.</p><p style="margin:20px 0">The same set of rules is also used for interpreting the meaning of the components of a modeling language structure. Following are some examples of modeling languages:</p><ul><li>Business Process Modeling Notation</li><li>Extended Enterprise Modeling Language Flowchart</li><li>Jackson Structured Programming</li><li>Systems Modeling Language</li><li>Unified Modeling Language</li></ul></div><button class="accordion">What is debugging? How is it related to testing?</button><div class="panel"><p>During the testing of a computer program, a number of issues are discovered. These are called errors and bugs. Debugging is the process of correcting them. In other words, debugging is the process of correcting the failures discovered in the implemented code.</p></div><button class="accordion">Can you please explain the DRY principle?</button><div class="panel"><p>DRY stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It is a software development principle that aims at reducing the repetition of software patterns. For achieving this, either the repetitive software patterns need to be replaced with abstractions or data normalization must be used.</p></div><button class="accordion">Please explain data structures.</button><div class="panel"><p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing and manipulating data. It allows efficient access as well as modification of data.<br>A data structure can also be defined as a collection of data, the functions applicable to them, and the relationships among them. Arrays, linked lists, heaps, graphs, and stacks are some examples of data structures.</p></div></div></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="how-to-prep"><center><h2 class="section-heading">How to prepare for an interview</h2></center><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>1. Research the organisation</h3><p>You’ll already know the basics from your research ahead of submitting your application, but now is the time to delve a bit deeper. What are their current projects? Have they been in the news? Who are their clients? Who will be interviewing you? Check out the organisation’s website, newspapers, or social media for this information. Showing you know what the organisation is up to will look good to your interviewers. If you have been told or can find out who will be interviewing you a bit of research about them (a quick look over their LinkedIn page will do) could potentially help reduce your nerves.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>2. Prep the possible questions – and their answers</h3><p>Looking at the job description and the skills required for the role should give you a steer on what kind of questions could be asked about your abilities and experience. List the possible questions and make a note of what your answers would be, but don’t worry about fitting in to an exact box. The interview is a chance to show your knowledge and skills but also your personality, so personal projects you’ve developed, or examples from hobbies or interests that are relevant might be of interest to the interviewer. It’s all of these things combined that will help to demonstrate why you are a good match for the job.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>3. Research career progression and training opportunities</h3><p>You’ll already know the basics from your research ahead of submitting your application, but now is the time to delve a bit deeper. What are their current projects? Have they been in the news? Who are their clients? Who will be interviewing you? Check out the organisation’s website, newspapers, or social media for this information. Showing you know what the organisation is up to will look good to your interviewers. If you have been told or can find out who will be interviewing you a bit of research about them (a quick look over their LinkedIn page will do) could potentially help reduce your nerves.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>4. Sort out extra support you might need</h3><p>If you need special access or additional materials to be arranged for your interview, make sure you get in touch with the organisation and let them know.</p><ul><li>Arranging for written materials to be amended into Braille, enlarged font, colour contrast or audio</li><li>Adding signs to the interview room</li><li>Adjusting chairs</li><li>Arranging for a sign language interpreter</li><li>Confirming alternative access such as ramps or rails</li></ul><p></p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>5. Plan the route</h3><p>Make sure you know where you are going and how long it takes to get there. If you can, go online and work out the easiest way to get there, then be sure to add on extra time so you’re totally covered. The last thing you want is to arrive flustered or late.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>6. Figure out what to wear</h3><p>The last thing you need is a frantic panic on the morning of the interview as you hunt for a suitable outfit. Planning what to wear a few days beforehand will let you focus on the important things. Check out this module for tips on what to wear for your interview.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>7. Think of the questions you’d like to ask</h3><p>During your research there will most likely have been things cropping up that you’d like to know more about. Write them out as clear questions for the interviewer. This will help you avoid an awkward silence when you’re asked if you have any questions. Check out our Top 5 questions to ask in your interview for more tips.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>8. Practice with friends or family</h3><p>Imagining what it feels like to be in the interview can help make it feel less daunting. Rehearsing questions and answers with friends, family or a mentor will be a huge help on the day.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>9. Read through your notes</h3><p>Re-familiarise yourself with the questions and answers you’ve prepared but don’t stress about trying to remember every single detail. A decent grasp of the main points will stop you ‘script-reading’ your answers, but if it helps, create a list of key skills, qualities and experience from your CV that you want to cover.</p></div><div class="how-to-prep-steps"><h3>10. Get a good night’s sleep</h3><p>You’ll undermine your preparations if you’re stifling yawns in the interview. Feeling refreshed and alert will also help you cope with any unforeseen situations that might get the nerves buzzing; like questions you maybe hadn’t thought of.</p></div></div><footer><!-- <hr style="color: #000; height: 0.5px;"> --><div class="footer-container" style="font-weight:100"><div class="left-col"><img src="../images/icon/logo.png"><div class="logo"></div><div class="social-media"><a href="https://www.facebook.com"><img src="../images/icon\fb.png"></a><a href="#"><img src="../images/icon\insta.png"></a><a href="#"><img src="../images/icon\tt.png"></a><a href="#"><img src="../images/icon\ytube.png"></a><a href="#"><img src="../images/icon\linkedin.png"></a></div><br><br><p class="rights-text">Copyright © 2021 Created By Team 7.
