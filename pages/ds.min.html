The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.<br>Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.<br>Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.</div></div><div class="implementation none animate__animated" id="implementation"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="ih">Implementation:</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="id">Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointerâ€”a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.<br>The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).</div></div><div class="examples none animate__animated" id="examples"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="eh">Examples:</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="ed"><li>There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types:</li><ol><li>An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.</li><li>A linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.</li><li>A record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.</li><li>A union is a data structure that specifies which of a number of permitted primitive types may be stored in its instances, e.g. float or long integer. Contrast with a record, which could be defined to contain a float and an integer; whereas in a union, there is only one value at a time. Enough space is allocated to contain the widest member datatype.</li><li>A tagged union (also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union) contains an additional field indicating its current type, for enhanced type safety.</li><li>An object is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record does, as well as various methods which operate on the data contents. An object is an in-memory instance of a class from a taxonomy. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.[11] In addition, graphs and binary trees are other commonly used data structures.</li><li>In addition, graphs and binary trees are other commonly used data structures.</li></ol></div></div><div class="references none animate__animated" id="references"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="rh">References:</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="rd"><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">Click here for Wikipedia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm">Click here for GeeksforGeeks</a></li><li><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-tutorial">Click here for Javatpoint</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sitesbay.com/data-structure/c-data-structure">Click here for Sitesbay</a></li></ol></div></div><div class="courses none animate__animated" id="courses"><div class="heading animate__animated" id="ch">Courses</div><br><br><div class="definition animate__animated" id="cd">Courses offered by the academys through online for data structures<ol><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?action=enroll">Click here for Coursera</a></li><li><a href="https://www.greatlearning.in/academy/learn-for-free/courses/data-structures-in-c">Click here for Greatlearning</a></li><li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/">Click here for Udemy</a></li></ol></div></div></div></body></html>
